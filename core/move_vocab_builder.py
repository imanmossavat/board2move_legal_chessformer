def build_move_vocab():
    """
    Builds a comprehensive vocabulary of pseudo-legal chess moves as UCI strings,
    covering all piece moves from all squares on an empty board, plus explicit handling 
    of castling and promotions (including promotion captures). 
    
    Key points and caveats:
    - Starts by placing each piece type for both colors on every square of an empty board,
      generating all pseudo-legal moves from that square.
    - Pseudo-legal means moves are generated without considering checks or full legality.
    - Castling moves are manually added because they arenâ€™t generated in the pseudo-legal moves 
      on an empty board.
    - Promotions are added in two steps:
       1) Normal forward promotions (e.g., e7e8q)
       2) Promotion captures (e.g., d7c8q) manually enumerated across adjacent files. This is because the previouse mechanism will not find the captures since there is only one piece on the board!
    - The function attempts to exhaustively cover all move possibilities relevant for move 
      prediction models or training, but due to complexity, some special cases might still be missing.
    - The resulting vocabulary maps UCI move strings to unique indices and vice versa.

    Warning: this is a Frankenstein's monster of heuristics, manual enumeration, and pseudo-legal 
    move generation, cobbled together to cover all moves you might see in typical chess datasets. 
    Use with care and double-check if certain rare moves or edge cases appear missing.

    Returns:
        uci_to_index (dict): Mapping from UCI move strings to unique integer indices.
        index_to_uci (dict): Reverse mapping from indices to UCI move strings.
