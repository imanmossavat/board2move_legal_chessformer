## ‚ôüÔ∏è Chess Move Prediction Project

This project implements a neural network-based system to predict the next move in a chess game. The model learns from PGN (Portable Game Notation) files and outputs probability distributions over a large vocabulary of chess moves. It's designed with flexibility, modularity, and practicality in mind for experimenting with transformer architectures on board game data.

## üìÅ Project Structure & File Descriptions

### `train.py`

**Purpose**:
Main training script that:

* Loads a PGN file.
* Prepares a custom dataset of board states and target move distributions.
* Initializes the transformer model.
* Trains the model using KL divergence between predicted and target move distributions.
* Logs training progress to CSV and saves model checkpoints.

---

### `model.py`

**Purpose**:
Defines `MinimalChessTransformer`, a transformer encoder architecture for chess board state classification. It:

* Embeds board features.
* Uses positional encodings.
* Adds learned biases for move components (from-square, to-square, promotion).
* Outputs logits over the entire move vocabulary.

---

### `dataset.py`

**Purpose**:
Contains custom `IterableDataset` subclasses:

* `ChessMoveDataset`: Parses PGN files into `(board_tensor, target_distribution)` samples, optionally with epsilon noise.
* `BufferedShuffleDataset`: Buffers and randomly yields samples for better shuffling when using streaming datasets.

---

### `tokenizer.py`

**Purpose**:
Tokenizes a `chess.Board` into a tensor representation used as model input. Includes:

* Piece and color encodings.
* Castling rights.
* En passant square.
* Legal move indicators.

Provides utility functions such as:

* `fen2board()` ‚Äì convert FEN strings to boards.
* `square_name_to_index()` ‚Äì map square notation to index.

---

### `move_vocab_builder.py`

**Purpose**:
Builds and loads a vocabulary of all possible pseudo-legal chess moves. Also:

* Handles special moves like castling and promotions.
* Saves and loads vocab from disk.
* Computes per-move component indices (from/to/promo) used for bias embeddings.

---

### `positional_encoding.py` *(Referenced but not shown)*

**Purpose**:
Presumably generates positional encodings for transformer input, e.g., using sinusoidal or learned embeddings for square positions on the board.

---

## üìä Key Features

* **PGN Parsing**: Converts real games into model-ready training samples.
* **Transformer Architecture**: Adapted to board games, with positional and piece-aware inputs.
* **Custom Move Vocabulary**: Comprehensive set of chess moves mapped to integer indices.
* **Streaming Dataset with Buffered Shuffle**: Efficient for large PGN files.
* **Epsilon-Greedy Target Distributions**: Blends correct move with legal alternatives for robustness.

## üöÄ How to Run

1. Place a `.pgn` file in your directory.
2. Edit the `pgn_path` in `train.py` to match your PGN file.
3. Run training:

   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```
4. Check `logs_<timestamp>/training_loss.csv` and `data/checkpoints/` for logs and saved models.
